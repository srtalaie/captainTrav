A site for a lab equipment company

[Link](https://safe-crag-59591.herokuapp.com/)

Built with Node/Express for the back end with MongoDB as the database.

Front end was built using React.js.

Added an admin panel so the user can add products to the back end themselves so I wouldn't have to add all of the products each time they get new stock.

Also asking for a quote sends an email to the site owner so they can respond back to a customer showing interest.
